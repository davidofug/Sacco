SACCO - Savings and Credit Coperatives application

Web based sacco management application.

Initially the Project was to help a small business to keep track of their members and disbursements but the system failed due to lack of funds, workmanship and other resources such as internet.

However in Uganda(Africa) there many new small savings and credit coperatives whose time is mostly spent on learning the procedures of running sacco and setting up a potential system to guide it's members. The time taken and the little usage of computers in the country hinders the usage of computer systems.
